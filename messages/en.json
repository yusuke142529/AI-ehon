        "content": "1. Purchase of Credits\n   Users may purchase Credits by paying the prescribed amount via Stripe or other payment methods on the purchase screen within the Service (for example, 1000 Credits for $10). Once the purchase is completed, the Credits are immediately reflected in the User’s account.\n\n2. Use and Consumption of Credits\n   When a User uses the picture book page generation feature, 20 Credits are consumed per page. This likewise applies to regeneration or additional pages; if there are not enough Credits, generation cannot proceed, and an additional purchase is required.\n\n3. Credit Validity and Refunds\n   Credits generally have no expiration date, and no refund is provided for unused Credits when withdrawing or deleting an account (except as otherwise provided by law).\n\n4. Credit History Inquiry\n   Users can check their Credit balance, purchase history, and consumption history within the Service."

Quality and Consistency of Generated Content\n   The accuracy, usefulness, and consistency of outputs from AI models are not guaranteed. Misinformation or inappropriate expressions may appear, so Users use them at their own risk, performing regeneration and corrections as needed.\n\n3. Storage and Editing\n   The generated picture book can be freely saved by the User, and can still be regenerated or edited after saving. However, each regeneration consumes Credits."

Prohibited Content\n   Posts that violate public order and morals, infringe on the rights of third parties, constitute defamation, discrimination, violence, obscene expressions, or other content the Company deems inappropriate are prohibited.\n\n4.
